The '''gray wolf''' or '''grey wolf''' (''Canis lupus'') is a [[canid]] native to the wilderness and remote areas of [[North America]], [[Eurasia]], and [[North Africa]]. It is the largest member of its family, with males averaging {{convert|43|-|45|kg|abbr=on}}, and females {{convert|36|-|38.5|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mech|1981|p=11}}</ref> It is similar in general appearance and proportions to a [[German shepherd]],<ref name="z124">{{Harvnb|Sillero-Zubiri|Hoffman|MacDonald|2004|p=124}}</ref> or [[sled dog]], but has a larger head, narrower chest, longer legs, straighter tail, and bigger paws.<ref name="l19" /> Its winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in colour, although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur.<ref name="z124" />

Within the [[genus]] ''[[Canis]]'', the gray wolf represents a more [[Generalist and specialist species|specialised]] and progressive form than its smaller cousins (the [[coyote]] and [[golden jackal]]), as demonstrated by its [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] adaptations to hunting large prey, its more gregarious nature,<ref name="s175">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=175}}</ref> and its highly advanced expressive behavior.<ref name="fox1978" /><ref name="z68" /> It is a [[social animal]], travelling in [[nuclear family|nuclear families]] consisting of a [[mated pair]], accompanied by the pair's adult offspring.<ref name="m1" /> The gray wolf is typically an [[apex predator]] throughout its range, with only [[human]]s and [[tiger]]s<ref name="WoT">Perry, Richard (1964).

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] word "wolf" stems from the [[Old English]] ''wulf'', which is itself thought to be derived from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*wulfaz'', from the [[Proto-Indo-European root]] ''*wlqwos''/''*lukwos''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=wolf |title= Online Etymological Dictionary|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref> [[Old English literature]] contains several instances of [[Anglo-Saxon kings]] and [[Anglo-Saxon warfare|warriors]] taking on ''wulf'' as a [[prefix]] or [[suffix]] in their names. Examples include Wulfhere, Cynewulf, Ceonwulf, Wulfheard, Earnwulf, Wulfmǣr, Wulfstān and Æthelwulf. Wolf-related names were also common among pre-Christian Germanic warriors: Wolfhroc (Wolf-Frock), Wolfhetan (Wolf Hide), Isangrim (Grey Mask), Scrutolf (Garb Wolf), Wolfgang (Wolf Gait) and Wolfdregil (Wolf Runner).<ref name="marvin74">{{Harvnb|Marvin|2012|pp=74–75}}</ref>

==Evolution and taxonomy==

===Origins===

====Ancestry====
The species' most likely ancestral candidate is ''[[Canis lepophagus]]'', a small, narrow skulled [[North America]]n canid of the [[Miocene]] era, which may have also given rise to the [[coyote]].<ref name="m239">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=239–45}}</ref> After the extinction of the large bodied ''[[Borophaginae]]'' family, ''C. lepophagus'' developed into a larger, broader-skulled animal. Fossils of this larger form of ''C. lepophagus'' found in northern [[Texas]] may represent the ancestral stock from which true wolves derive.<ref name="evolution">{{cite journal | last1 = Nowak | first1 = R. | year = 1992 | title = Wolves: The great travelers of evolution |journal = International Wolf | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 3–7 }}</ref> The first true wolves began to appear at the end of the [[Blancan|Blancan North American Stage]] and the onset of the early [[Irvingtonian]]. Among them was ''C. priscolatrans'', a small species closely resembling the modern-day [[red wolf]], which colonised [[Eurasia]] by crossing the [[Bering land bridge]]. The new Eurasian ''C. priscolatrans'' population gradually evolved into ''C. mosbachensis'',<ref name="m239" /> which closely resembled modern wolves found in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[South Asia]], which were once distributed in [[Europe]] in the early [[Quaternary glaciation]] until about 500,000 years ago (see ''[[Wolf#Subspecies|Subspecies]]'').<ref name="h38" /> ''C. mosbachensis'' subsequently evolved in the direction of ''C. lupus''.<ref name="m239" /> The earliest ''C. lupus'' remains date back to the [[middle Pleistocene]], and occur in [[Beringia]].<ref>Wang, Xiaoming & Telford, R. H. (2008), ''Dogs: their fossil relatives and evolutionary history'', Columbia University Press, p. 148</ref>{{clear}}

====Subspeciation====
[[File:Arabianwolfjackal.jpg|thumb|The [[Egyptian jackal|African wolf]] (''C. l. lupaster'') represents the oldest extant lineage of the species<ref name="gaubert" />]]
[[MtDNA]] studies have shown that there are at least four distinct gray wolf lineages: the most ancient is that of the African wolf (native to [[North Africa|North]], [[West Africa|West]], and [[East Africa]]), which is thought to have originated as early as the Middle to Late Pleistocene.<ref name="gaubert">{{Cite journal|author=Gaubert P, Bloch C, Benyacoub S, Abdelhamid A, Pagani P, et al|year=2012|title= Reviving the African Wolf ''Canis lupus lupaster'' in North and West Africa: A Mitochondrial Lineage Ranging More than 6,000 km Wide|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=8|page=e42740|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0042740|pmid=22900047|pmc=3416759}}</ref> All other lineages occur together in the [[Indian Subcontinent]], the oldest of which is the Himalayan wolf (native to the Himalayan region of eastern [[Kashmir]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], parts of [[Tibet]] and eastern [[Nepal]]), which is thought to have originated 800,000 years ago, when the Himalayan region was going through major geologic and climatic upheaval. The peninsular Indian wolf, ''[[Indian Wolf|C. l. pallipes]]'', likely diverged from the Himalayan wolf 400,000 years ago.<ref name="j+s2004">{{cite journal | last1 = Jhala | first1 = Y. | last2 = Sharma | first2 = D.

The now extinct Japanese wolves were descended from large Siberian wolves which colonised the [[Korean Peninsula]] and [[Japan]], before it separated from mainland Asia, 20,000 years ago during the Pleistocene. During the Holocene, the [[Tsugaru Strait]] widened and isolated [[Honshu]] from [[Hokkaidō]], thus causing climatic changes leading to the extinction of most large bodied ungulates inhabiting the archipelago. Japanese wolves likely underwent a process of [[island dwarfism]] 7,000–13,000 years ago in response to these climatological and ecological pressures. ''[[Hokkaidō Wolf|C. l. hattai]]'' (formerly native to Hokkaidō) was significantly larger than its southern cousin ''[[Honshu wolf|C. l. hodophilax]]'', as it inhabited higher elevations and had access to larger prey, as well as a continuing genetic interaction with dispersing wolves from Siberia.<ref name="w41">{{Harvnb|Walker|2005|p=41}}</ref>{{clear}}

====Colonization of North America====
''Canis lupus'' colonized North America during the late [[Rancholabrean]] era.<ref name="m245">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=245–250}}</ref> The larger ''[[Canis dirus]]'' was already established there, but it became extinct 8,000 years ago, after the large prey it relied on disappeared. Competition with the newly arrived gray wolf for the smaller and swifter prey that survived may have contributed to its decline. The [[eastern wolf]]/[[red wolf]] appeared to evolve along with the coyote from a common North American ancestor.<ref name=Chambers/> In contrast, the gray wolf evolved in Eurasia and migrated into the northern and western portions of North American.

The North American recolonisation likely occurred in several waves, with the most distinctive populations occurring in the periphery of the range. These populations ''[[Arctic wolf|C. l. arctos]]'' on the high arctic islands, ''[[eastern wolf|C. l. lycaon]]'' in the eastern forests, and ''[[Mexican wolf|C. l. baileyi]]'' in the far south) may represent survivors of early migrations from Eurasia. ''C. l. baileyi'' and ''C. l. lycaon'' display some primitive traits and systematic affinity to one another. Fossil remains from the late Pleistocene of large bodied wolves similar to ''C. l. arctos'' and ''[[tundra wolf|C. l. albus]]'' occur in coastal southern [[California]], indicating that large North American gray wolf subspecies were once widespread, and may have been driven southward by [[glaciation]], though wolves no longer reside there. Fossils of small bodied wolves similar to ''C. l. baileyi'' have been found in a range encompassing Kansas and southern California. This indicates a late Pleistocene population flux, in which large, Arctic forms of wolf moved farther south, with smaller, warmth adapted wolves expanding as the climate moderated.<ref name="m245" />

{{As of|2005|uc=on}},<ref name="msw3">{{MSW3 Wozencraft|pages =|id =14000738}}</ref> 37 [[subspecies]] of gray wolf are recognised by [[MSW3]]. There are 2 more subspecies of ''Canis lupus'': the [[domestic dog]] and the [[dingo]].

Wolf subspecies are divided into two categories:
*"'''Northern wolves'''": large-sized, large-brained wolves with strong [[carnassials]] which inhabit North America, Europe and northern Asia.<ref name="h40" />
*"'''Southern wolves'''": native to the Arabian Peninsula, South Asia and possibly North Africa.

[[File:Wolf-evolution.svg|thumb|Chart detailing divergence of North American ''Canis''.]]
[[MSW3]] in 2005 considered the [[eastern wolf|eastern Canada wolf/eastern wolf]] (''Canis lycaon'') of [[Algonquin Provincial Park]] and the [[red wolf]] (''Canis rufus'') of [[North Carolina]] as gray wolf subspecies. These considerations were initially supported by a large mitochondrial [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] study in 2011. The 2011 SNP study suggested that the red wolf and eastern wolf are in fact the results of varying degrees of [[coywolf|wolf–coyote hybridization]] stretching back to only a few centuries.<ref name="genome">{{cite pmid|21566151}}</ref> However, X-Ray analysis of the 16 red wolf specimens used in the SNP study were later shown to be wolf-coyote hybrids via cranial morphometric analysis, rendering the finding that the red wolf was a gray wolf-coyote hybrid inaccurate.<ref name=Beeland>{{cite book |title=The Secret World of Red Wolves |author=T.

In summary, in historical times the gray wolf and coyote ranged generally west of the Mississippi River, while the red wolf and eastern wolf ranged across the forested eastern United States and southeastern Canada. Culling of the red wolf/ eastern wolf associated with European colonization enabled eastward migration of coyotes and hybridization between these species (which share a relatively recent common ancestor) whereas the gray wolf and coyote in the western United States are more distant evolutionary relatives and do not hybridize.<ref name=Rutledge2/> Gray wolves do hybridize with the red wolf/eastern wolf as well as with the now dominant Canis species in eastern North America, the [[coywolf]].

===Domestication===
{{Main|Origin of the domestic dog}}
Morphological comparisons between wolves and domestic dogs have narrowed the likely ancestral subspecies of gray wolf to [[Canis Lupus arabs|Middle Eastern and South Asian wolves]].<ref name="h38" /> This is confirmed by [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] studies done in 2010, which point to the Middle East as the source of most of the genetic diversity in the domestic dog and the most likely origin of domestication events.<ref name="vonHoldt_et_al_2010">{{cite doi|10.1038/nature08837}}</ref> The actual process undergone in domesticating the wolf is still debated. Although it is popularly assumed that dogs originated as a result of [[artificial selection]], the general intractability of adult wolves to human handling has led certain experts to theorise that the domestication process occurred through [[natural selection]], when [[Mesolithic]] human communities began building permanent settlements in which a new [[ecological niche]] ([[midden]]s and [[landfill]]s) was opened to wolves. These wolves would have formed a [[commensalism|commensal relationship]] with humans, feeding on their waste over many generations, with natural selection favouring assertive wolves with shorter [[flight distance]]s in human presence, and causing physical changes related to the redundancy of features adapted for hunting big game.<ref name="c39">{{Harvnb|Coppinger|Coppinger|2001|pp=39–67}}</ref>

Although dogs are the wolf's closest relative (the [[genetic divergence]] between gray wolves and dogs is only 1.8%, as opposed to over 4% between gray wolves, [[Ethiopian wolf|Ethiopian wolves]] and [[coyote]]s),<ref name="m225">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=225}}</ref> comparative studies on dog and wolf behaviour and anatomy have shown that dog physiology and most dog behaviours are comparable to those of young wolves, an example of [[neoteny]] and [[pedomorphism]].<ref name="h83">{{Harvnb|Hemmer|1990|p=83}}</ref> The [[Auditory bulla|tympanic bullae]] are large, convex and almost spherical in wolves, while the bullae of dogs are smaller, compressed and slightly crumpled.<ref name="mech" /> Compared to equally sized dogs, wolves tend to have 20% larger skulls and 10% bigger brains.<ref name="c54">{{Harvnb|Coppinger|Coppinger|2001|pp=54–5}}</ref> This reduction lies in the parts of the brain that deal with sense impressions.<ref name="z9">{{Harvnb|Zimen|1981|p=9}}</ref> The teeth of wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs; [[premolar]]s and [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s of wolves are much less crowded, and have more complex [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusp]] patterns.<ref>Clutton-Brock, Juliet (1987), ''A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals'', British Museum (Natural History), p. 24, ISBN 0-521-34697-5</ref> Dogs lack a functioning [[pre-caudal gland]], and most enter [[estrus]] twice yearly, unlike wolves which only do so once annually.<ref name="m257">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=257}}</ref>{{clear}}

====Hybridization with coyotes and golden jackals====

Numerous genetic studies indicate that eastern wolves have hybridized with coyotes in varying degrees in different areas. Studies on [[mtDNA]] and [[microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite loci]] indicate that wolves have hybridized extensively with coyotes in the northeastern [[USA]] and southeastern [[Canada]], with the frequency of coyote [[haplotype]]s in wolves tending to increase to the east, from 50% in [[Minnesota]], to 100% in southern [[Quebec]].<ref name="m234">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=234}}</ref> [[Canis latrans "var."|These hybrids]] called "coywolves" (or "coywolf" for singular) are smaller than wolves, and hold smaller territories, but are in turn larger and hold more extensive territories than coyotes.<ref name="easterncoyote">{{cite journal | last1 = Way | first1 = Jonathan G. | year = 2008 | title = Eastern Coyote: Coyote, Wolf, or Hybrid? | url = http://www.projectcoyote.org/newsreleases/news_eastern.html | journal = International Wolf | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 7–10 }}</ref> These coywolves appear to have resulted from hybridization of coyotes migrating east over the Great Lakes with eastern wolves or hybrids between eastern wolves and Great Plains wolves, and are larger and better adapted to habitat and prey south of the moose-dominated "North Woods" of New England.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Taxonomic Implications of Morphological and Genetic Differences in Northeastern Coyotes (Coywolves) (Canis latrans × C. lycaon), Western Coyotes (C. latrans), and Eastern Wolves (C. lycaon or C. lupus lycaon) |author=Jonathan G.

In an evolutionary biology research conducted by a team of researchers in the Uppsala University, analysis of control region haplotypes of the mitochondrial DNA and sex chromosomes from Mexican wolves, a critically endangered subspecies of the gray wolf once nearly driven to extinction in the wild, confirmed the presence of coyote markers in some of the wolves.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Hybridization among Three Native North American Canis Species in a Region of Natural Sympatry |authors=Frank Hailer, Jennifer A. Leonard |journal=PLoS One |year=2008 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0003333 |accessdate=2014-02-09 }}</ref> The study suggests that when the subspecies became depleted in the wild from persecution, female coyotes in the south managed to interbreed with some of the male wolves of the remnant wild Mexican wolf populations with the female hybrids backcrossing with other male wolves. Analysis on the haplotype of some coyotes from Texas also detected the presence of male wolf introgression such as Y chromosomes from the gray wolves in the southern coyotes. In an extremely rare case, the study found that one coyote out of the seventy individuals from Texas was discovered to carry a mtDNA haplotype derived from a female Mexican wolf implicating that a male coyote had managed to breed with a female grey wolf in the wild. The Mexican wolves may be the only gray wolf subspecies in the southern States besides the domestic and feral dogs to have hybridized with coyotes. However, their findings may be better explained by red wolf-coyote hybrids mating with gray wolves, since gray wolves mate with red wolves but almost never with coyotes.<ref name=Chambers/>

In tests performed on a sample from a taxidermied carcass of what was initially labelled as a [[chupacabra]], mtDNA analysis conducted by Texas State University professor Michael Forstner showed that it was a coyote. Subsequent analysis by a veterinary genetics laboratory team at the University of California, Davis concluded that, based on the sex chromosomes, the male animal was a coyote–wolf [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] sired by a male [[Mexican wolf]].<ref name=Bionews-tx>http://bionews-tx.com/news/2013/09/01/texas-state-university-researcher-helps-unravel-mystery-of-texas-blue-dog-claimed-to-be-chupacabra/</ref><ref>http://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/2008/oct/31/sl_chupa_12/</ref> It has been suggested that the hybrid animal was afflicted with [[sarcoptic mange]], which would explain its hairless and blueish appearance.

In 2013, a captive breeding experiment conducted in the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services National Wildlife Research Center Predator Research Facility in Logan, Utah between gray wolves from British Columbia and western coyotes produced six hybrids, making this the very first hybridization case between pure coyotes and northwestern gray wolves.<ref>http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=3812#.UxFuc_ldWwQ</ref> The experiment used artificial insemination and was aimed with the intention of determining whether or not if the sperms of the larger gray wolves in the west are capable of fertilizing the egg cells in the western coyotes. Aside from the historical hybridizations between coyotes and the smaller Mexican gray wolves in the south as well as with eastern wolves and red wolves, grays wolves from the northwestern USA and western provinces of Canada are not known to interbreed with coyotes in the wild, thus prompted the experiment. The six hybrids brought out from this captive breeding included four males and two females. These coywolves were shortly rehomed at the Wildlife Science Center in Forest Lake, Minnesota where they have been living under the care of professional wildlife caretakers from there on. At six months of age, the hybrids were closely monitored and were shown to display both physical and behaviourial characteristics from both species as well as some physical similarities to the eastern wolves, whose status as a distinct wolf species or as a genetically distinct subspecies of the gray wolf is still being debated among various researchers.<ref name="plosone.org"/> Regardless, the result of this experiment concluded that northwestern gray wolves, much like the eastern wolves, red wolves, Mexican wolves, and domestic dogs, are indeed capable of hybridizing with coyotes. Although this hybridization was brought out through artificial insemination due to the gray wolves' natural hostility towards coyotes which would have caused difficulties in attempting to naturally breed the two rival species together.

Although hybridization between wolves and golden jackals has never been observed, evidence of such occurrences was discovered through mtDNA analysis on jackals in [[Senegal]]<ref name="gaubert" /> and [[Bulgaria]].<ref name="moura">{{Cite journal|author=Moura, Andre E., et al|year=2013|title= Unregulated hunting and genetic recovery from a severe population decline: the cautionary case of Bulgarian wolves|journal=Conservation Genetics|volume=14|issue=|page=|doi=    10.1007/s10592-013-0547-y}}</ref>

===Anatomy===
{{see also|Dog anatomy}}

The gray wolf is a slender, powerfully built animal with a large, deeply descending [[ribcage]] and a sloping back. Its abdomen is pulled in, and its neck heavily muscled. Its limbs are long and robust, with comparatively small paws.<ref name="s166">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=166}}</ref> The front paws have five toes each, while the back paws have four. The forelimbs are seemingly pressed into the chest, with the elbows pointed inward, and the feet outward, thus allowing both fore and hind limbs on the same side to swing in the same line. The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids. This enables the animal to move swiftly, and allows it to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range.<ref name="mech13">{{Harvnb|Mech|1981|p=13}}</ref> Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males.<ref name="l23">{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|p=23}}</ref> Compared to its smaller cousins (the [[coyote]] and [[golden jackal]]), the gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and longer tail.<ref name="gaubert" /><ref name="mech">{{cite journal | last1 = Mech | first1 = D.

[[File:Wolf on the move.jpg|thumb|left|[[Northwestern wolf]] (''C. l. occidentalis'') trotting, [[Denali National Park]]. When moving, the wolf generally places its hind paws in the tracks made by the front paws.<ref name="mech13"/>]]

The gray wolf's head is large and heavy, with a wide forehead, strong jaws and a long, blunt muzzle. The ears are relatively small and triangular.<ref name="s166" /> The teeth are heavy and large, being better suited to crushing bone than those of other extant canids, though not as specialised as those found in [[hyena]]s.<ref name="therrien">{{cite doi|10.1017/S0952836905007430}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=112}}</ref> The [[canine teeth]] are robust and relatively short (26&nbsp;mm).<ref name="mech" /> The wolf can exert a crushing pressure of perhaps {{convert|10340|kPa|abbr=on}} compared to {{convert|5200|kPa|abbr=on}} for a [[German shepherd]]. This force is sufficient to break open most bones.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|p=26}}</ref> In cold climates, the wolf can reduce the flow of blood near its skin to conserve body heat. The warmth of the footpads is regulated independently of the rest of the body, and is maintained at just above [[frostbite|tissue-freezing]] point where the pads come in contact with ice and snow.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|pp=19–20}}</ref>

The gray wolf usually carries its head at the same level as the back, raising it only when alert.<ref name="s166" /> It usually travels at a loping pace, placing its paws one directly in front of the other. This gait can be maintained for hours at a rate of 8–9&nbsp;km/h,<ref name="m32">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=32}}</ref> and allows the wolf to cover great distances. On bare paths, a wolf can quickly achieve speeds of 50–60&nbsp;km/h. The gray wolf has a running gait of 55 to 70&nbsp;km/h, can leap 5 metres horizontally in a single bound, and can maintain rapid pursuit for at least 20 minutes.<ref>Nowak, Ronald M; and Paradiso, John L. (1983). ''Walker's Mammals of the World''. 4th ed.

===Fur===
[[File:Black and White Wolves.jpg|thumb|left|Black and white-furred wolves, [[Pays de la Loire]]]]
The gray wolf has very dense and fluffy winter fur, with short underfur and long, coarse [[guard hair]]s.<ref name="s166" /> Most of the underfur and some of the guard hairs are shed in the spring and grow back in the autumn period.<ref name="l19" /> The longest hairs occur on the back, particularly on the front quarters and neck. Especially long hairs are found on the shoulders, and almost form a crest on the upper part of the neck. The hairs on the cheeks are elongated and form tufts. The ears are covered in short hairs which strongly project from the fur. Short, elastic and closely adjacent hairs are present on the limbs from the [[elbow]]s down to the [[calcaneal tendon]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=167}}</ref> The winter fur is highly resistant to cold; wolves in northern climates can rest comfortably in open areas at −40° by placing their muzzles between the rear legs and covering their faces with their tail. Wolf fur provides better insulation than dog fur, and does not collect ice when warm breath is condensed against it.<ref name="l19" /> In warm climates, the fur is coarser and scarcer than in northern wolves.<ref name="s166" /> Female wolves tend to have smoother furred limbs than males, and generally develop the smoothest overall coats as they age. Older wolves generally have more white hairs in the tip of the tail, along the nose and on the forehead. The winter fur is retained longest in lactating females, though with some hair loss around their nipples.<ref name="l23" /> Hair length on the middle of the back is 60–70&nbsp;mm. Hair length of the guard hairs on the shoulders generally does not exceed 90&nbsp;mm, but can reach 110–130&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=169}}</ref>

Coat colour ranges from almost pure white through various shades of blond, cream, and ochre to grays, browns, and blacks.<ref name="l21">{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|p=21}}</ref> Variation in fur color tends to increase in higher latitudes.<ref name="mech16">{{Harvnb|Mech|1981|pp=16–17}}</ref> Differences in coat colour between sexes are largely absent,<ref>{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=168}}</ref> though females may have redder tones.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|p=22}}</ref> Fur color doesn't seem to serve any [[camouflage]] purpose, with some experts concluding that the blended colors have more to do with emphasizing certain gestures during interaction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|p=45}}</ref> [[Black wolf (animal)|Black coloured wolves]] (which occur through [[wolf-dog hybrid]]isation) rarely occur in Eurasia, where interactions with domestic dogs have been reduced over the past thousand years due to the depletion of wild wolf populations.

===Sensory abilities===
The gray wolf's [[sense of smell]] is relatively weakly developed when compared to that of some [[hunting dog]] breeds, being able to detect carrion upwind no farther than 2–3&nbsp;km. Because of this, it rarely manages to capture hidden hares or birds, though it can easily follow fresh tracks. Its [[auditory perception]] is sharper than that of the [[fox]],<ref name="s242">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=242–244}}</ref> being able to hear up to a frequency of 26&nbsp;kHz,<ref name="l43" /> which is sufficient to register the fall of leaves in the autumn period.<ref name="s242" /> The [[urban legend]] that wolves fear the sound of [[string instrument]]s may have a basis in fact, as captive wolves have been shown to exhibit signs of intense distress when hearing low minor chords.<ref name="cornish">{{Cite journal|last1=Cornish|first1=Charles J.|last2=Selous|first2=Frederick C.|last3=Johnston|first3=Harry H.|last4=Maxwell|first4=Herbert|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/livinganimalsofw01cornrich#page/n7/mode/2up|title=The living animals of the world; a popular natural history with one thousand illustrations|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company |year=1902|ref=harv|accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> Its [[night vision]] exceeds that of other Canids.<ref name="s242" />

===Social and territorial behaviors===

Although [[Lone wolf (trait)|some wolves are solitary]], most are highly gregarious animals.<ref name="f495">{{Harvnb|Feldhamer|Thompson|Chapman|2003|p=495}}</ref> The basic social unit of a wolf [[Pack (canine)|pack]] is the mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult offspring.{{efn|In the past, the prevailing view on wolf packs was that they consisted of individuals vying with each other for dominance, with dominant wolves being referred to as the "alpha" male and female, and the subordinates as "beta" and "omega" wolves. This terminology was first used in 1947 by Rudolf Schenkel of the [[University of Basel]], who based his findings on researching the behavior of captive wolves. This view on wolf pack dynamics was later popularized by [[L. David Mech]] in his 1970 book ''The Wolf''. He formally disavowed this terminology in 1999, explaining that it was heavily based on the behavior of captive packs consisting of unrelated individuals, an error reflecting the once prevailing view that wild pack formation occurred in winter among independent wolves. Later research on wild wolves revealed that the pack is usually a family consisting of a breeding pair and its offspring of the previous 1–3 years.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mech, L.

Wolves are highly [[territory (animal)|territorial]] animals, and generally establish territories far larger than they require to survive in order to assure a steady supply of prey.

The gray wolf is generally [[monogamous]], with mated pairs usually remaining together for life, unless one of the pair dies. Upon the death of one mated wolf, pairs are quickly re-established. Since males often predominate in any given wolf population, unpaired females are a rarity.<ref name="s248">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=248}}</ref> If a dispersing male wolf is unable to establish a territory or find a mate, he mates with the daughters of already established breeding pairs from other packs. Such wolves are termed "[[Casanova]] wolves" and, unlike males from established packs, they do not form [[pair bond]]s with the females they mate with. Some wolf packs may have multiple breeding females this way, as is the case in [[History of Wolves in Yellowstone|Yellowstone National Park]].<ref>Smith, Douglas W. (2006) ''Decade of the Wolf: Returning the Wild to Yellowstone'', Lyons Press, ISBN 1-59228-886-3</ref> Gray wolves also practice [[Alloparenting|alloparental care]], in which a wolf pair may adopt the pup or pups of another. This might take place if the original parents die or are for some reason separated from them. This behavior is common and is seen in many other animal species like the elephant.<ref>Riedman, Marianne L. (December 1982). “The Evolution of Alloparental Care in Mammals and Birds”.

The age of first breeding in wolves depends largely on environmental factors: when food is plentiful, or when wolf populations are heavily managed, wolves can rear pups at younger ages in order to better exploit abundant resources. This is further demonstrated by the fact that captive wolves have been known to breed as soon as they reach 9–10 months, while the youngest recorded breeding wolves in the wild were 2 years old. Females are capable of producing pups every year, with one [[litter (animal)|litter]] annually being the average. Unlike the coyote, the gray wolf never reaches [[Menopause|reproductive senescence]].<ref name="m175">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=175}}</ref> [[Estrus]] typically occurs in late winter, with older, multiparous females entering estrus 2–3 weeks earlier than younger females.<ref name="s248" /> When [[sexually receptive|receptive]], the female averts the base of her tail to one side, exposing the [[Canine female reproductive system|vulva]].<ref name="MechBoitani2003" /> During mating, the male's [[bulbus glandis]] expands, locking the pair into a [[copulatory tie]]<ref name="MechBoitani2003">{{cite book|author1=Mech, L.

Wolves bear relatively large pups in small litters compared to other canid species.<ref name="m47">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=46–49}}</ref> The average litter consists of 5–6 pups,<ref name="m176">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=176}}</ref><ref name="g42">{{Harvnb|Graves|2007|p=42}}</ref> with litter sizes tending to increase in areas where prey is abundant,<ref name="m176" /> though exceptionally large litters of 14–17 pups occur only 1% of the time.<ref name="g42" /> Pups are usually born in spring, coinciding with a corresponding increase in prey populations.<ref name="m42" /> Pups are born blind and deaf, and are covered in short soft grayish-brown fur. They weigh 300–500&nbsp;grams at birth, and begin to see after 9–12 days. The milk canines erupt after one month. Pups first leave the den after 3 weeks. At 1.5 months of age, they are agile enough to flee from danger. Mother wolves do not leave the den for the first few weeks, relying on the fathers to provide food for them and their young. Pups begin to eat solid food at the age of 3–4 weeks. Pups have a fast growth rate during their first four months of life: during this period, a pup's weight can increase nearly 30 times.<ref name="m47" /><ref name="s253">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=253–54}}</ref> Wolf pups begin play fighting at the age of 3 weeks, though unlike young foxes and coyotes, their bites are inhibited.

===Denning and sheltering behaviour===
Wolves use different places for their diurnal rest: places with cover are preferred during cold, damp and windy weather, while wolves in dry, calm and warm weather readily rest in the open. During the autumn-spring period, when wolves are more active, they willingly lie out in the open, whatever their location. Actual dens are usually constructed for pups during the summer period. When building dens, females make use of natural shelters such as fissures in rocks, cliffs overhanging riverbanks and holes thickly covered by vegetation. Sometimes, the den is the appropriated burrow of smaller animals such as foxes, badgers or marmots. An appropriated den is often widened and partly remade. On rare occasions, female wolves dig burrows themselves, which are usually small and short with 1–3 openings.<ref name="s234" /> Wolves do not line their denning places, a likely precaution against parasites.<ref name="ern760">{{Harvnb|Seton|1909|p=760}}</ref> The den is usually constructed not more than 500 metres away from a water source,<ref name="s234">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=234–39}}</ref> and typically faces southwards, thus ensuring enough sunlight exposure, keeping the denning area relatively snow free.<ref name="f486">{{Harvnb|Feldhamer|Thompson|Chapman|2003|p=486}}</ref> Resting places, play areas for the pups and food remains are commonly found around wolf dens. The odour of urine and rotting food emanating from the denning area often attracts scavenging birds such as [[magpie]]s and [[raven]]s. As there are few convenient places for burrows, wolf dens are usually occupied by animals of the same family. Though they mostly avoid areas within human sight, wolves have been known to nest near [[Architecture|domiciles]], paved [[road]]s and [[railway]]s.<ref name="s234" />

===Intelligence===
{{See also|Dog intelligence}}
Although the wolf's [[intelligence]] has not been quantified, scattered reports<ref name="mech8">{{Harvnb|Mech|1981|pp=8–9}}</ref> and laboratory studies<ref name="m63">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=63–65}}</ref> do give indications on the species' ability to remember, associate events, and learn.
During the extermination of the [[American bison]] on the [[Great Plains]], wolves learned to follow the sounds of gunshots, and would wait until the hunters had skinned and abandoned the bison carcasses before feeding on them. In northern Montana, where wolves were heavily persecuted by aerial hunters, wolves learned to avoid open areas whenever they heard aircraft. Conversely, biologists using aircraft to study wolves have managed to condition wolves not to fear their approach, even when flying low. When hunting, wolves tend to target the easiest options available to them: in areas populated by both [[moose]] and smaller [[deer]] species, the latter are taken in much higher proportion. The wolf's powers of memory were described by [[George Mivart]], who reported that a tame wolf was able to recognise its master after a three-year absence.<ref name="mech8" /> Non-rabid wolves are able to distinguish between armed and unarmed people,<ref name="s244">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=244–245}}</ref> and typically avoid investigating people who display self-confident demeanors typical of being armed.<ref name="geist" /> Adult wolves have been known to skillfully select hidden approaches when entering their dens, using bushes, wind-fallen trees, stumps, and other natural structures to conceal their approach.<ref name="s244" /> Wolves with prior experience to traps may learn how to avoid or even harmlessly trigger them: in his hunt for the [[Lobo the King of Currumpaw|Currumpaw wolf]], naturalist [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] noted that his initial attempts at capturing it were unsuccessful, as the wolf would dig up and spring the traps, or ignore them altogether.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|p=192}}</ref>
[[File:Lobo exposing the traps.png|thumb|''Lobo unearthing the traps'' (1898), [[Ernest Thompson Seton]]]]

Though wolves are trainable, they lack the same degree of tractability seen in dogs. They are generally not as responsive as dogs are to coercive techniques involving fear, aversive stimuli and force. Generally, far more work is required to obtain the same degree of reliability seen in most dogs. Even then, once a certain behavior has been repeated several times, wolves may get bored and ignore subsequent commands. Wolves are more responsive toward positive conditioning and rewards,<ref name="training">{{cite web | url= http://www.wolfpark.org/wolfdogs/Poster_section7.html| title= Are wolves and wolfdog hybrids trainable? | publisher= Wolf Park| accessdate= 2008-10-30 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080615124627/http://www.wolfpark.org/wolfdogs/Poster_section7.html |archivedate = 2008-06-15}}</ref> though simple praise is not sufficient as in most dogs.<ref name="training2" /> Unlike dogs, wolves tend to respond more to hand signals than voice.<ref name="training2">{{cite web | url= http://www.wolfpark.org/training/Example-1.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080210012443/http://www.wolfpark.org/training/Example-1.html |archivedate=February 10, 2008 | title= Wolf Training and Socialisation: Example #1 | publisher= Wolf Park| accessdate= 2008-10-30}}</ref> Most attempts to train wolves as [[working dog]]s have met with failure. German biologist Erik Zimen attempted to train his captive wolves as [[sled dog]]s, and although his wolves eventually accepted the harness and the need to pull the sled in a straight line, they were ultimately unreliable, as they fought for personal space, would ignore commands once tired, and were distracted by other wildlife.<ref name="z88">{{Harvnb|Zimen|1981|pp=88–90}}</ref> However, [[John James Audubon]] recorded an instance of a wolf being trained to hunt deer in [[Kentucky]],<ref>Audubon, John James & Bachman, John (1851), ''The viviparous quadrupeds of North America, Volume 2'', p. 130</ref> and [[Henry Wharton Shoemaker]] published a similar account of settlers in western and central [[Pennsylvania]] using wolves as hunting dogs.<ref>Shoemaker, Henry Warton (1917) ''Extinct Pennsylvania Animals: The panther and the wolf.-Pt.

===Hunting and feeding behaviours===
[[File:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|right|[[American Bison]] standing its ground, thereby increasing its chance of survival]]
Although social animals, single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs, with single wolves having occasionally been observed to kill large prey such as moose, [[bison]] and [[muskox]]en unaided.<ref name="m119">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=119–121}}</ref> A wolf hunt can be divided into five stages:

* '''Locating prey:''' The wolves travel in search of prey through their power of scent, chance encounter, and tracking. Wolves typically locate their prey by scent, though they must usually be directly downwind of it. When a breeze carrying the prey's scent is located, the wolves stand alert, and point their eyes, ears and nose towards their target. In open areas, wolves may precede the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the wolves head towards their prey.<ref name="mech196">{{Harvnb|Mech|1981|pp=196–199}}</ref>
* '''The stalk:''' The wolves attempt to conceal themselves as they approach.<ref name="g43">{{Harvnb|Graves|2007|p=43}}</ref> As the gap between the wolves and their prey closes, the wolves quicken their pace, wag their tails, and peer intently, getting as close to their quarry as possible without making it flee.<ref name="mech199">{{Harvnb|Mech|1981|pp=199–200}}</ref>
* '''The encounter:''' Once the prey detects the wolves, it can either approach the wolves, stand its ground, or flee. Large prey, such as [[moose]], [[elk]], and muskoxen, usually stand their ground. Should this occur, the wolves hold back, as they require the stimulus of a running animal to proceed with an attack.<ref name="mech200">{{Harvnb|Mech|1981|pp=200–201}}</ref> If the targeted animal stands its ground, the wolves either ignore it, or try to intimidate it into running.<ref name="m119" />
* '''The rush:''' If the prey attempts to flee, the wolves immediately pursue it. This is the most critical stage of the hunt, as wolves may never catch up with prey running at top speed.<ref name="mech201">{{Harvnb|Mech|1981|pp=201–202}}</ref> If their prey is travelling in a group, the wolves either attempt to break up the herd, or isolate one or two animals from it.<ref name="g43" />
* '''The chase:''' A continuation of the rush, the wolves attempt to catch up with their prey and kill it.<ref name="mech202">{{Harvnb|Mech|1981|pp=202–203}}</ref> When chasing small prey, wolves attempt to catch up with their prey as soon as possible, while with larger animals, the chase is prolonged, in order to wear the selected prey out. Wolves usually give up chases after 1–2&nbsp;km (0.62–1.3&nbsp;mi), though one wolf was recorded to chase a deer for {{convert|21|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="m119" /> Both Russian and North American wolves have been observed to drive prey onto crusted ice, precipices, ravines, slopes and steep banks to slow them down.<ref name="g45" />
[[File:Wolves killing caribou.png|thumb||left|Killing a [[Caribou (North America)|caribou]] in typical fashion: biting the hindquarters (1909 drawing by [[Arthur Robert Harding|A. R. Harding]])]]

The actual killing method varies according to prey species. With large prey, mature wolves usually avoid attacking frontally, instead focusing on the rear and sides of the animal. Large prey, such as moose, is killed by biting large chunks of flesh from the soft [[perineum]] area, causing massive [[blood loss]]. Such bites can cause wounds 10–15&nbsp;cm in length, with three such bites to the perineum usually being sufficient to bring down a large deer in optimum health.<ref name="g45">{{Harvnb|Graves|2007|p=45}}</ref> With medium-sized prey such as [[roe deer]] or [[sheep]], wolves kill by biting the throat, severing nerve tracks and the [[carotid artery]], thus causing the animal to die within a few seconds to a minute. With small, [[mouse]]-like prey, wolves leap in a high arc and imobilize it with their forepaws.<ref name="z217">{{Harvnb|Zimen|1981|pp=217–218}}</ref> When prey is vulnerable and abundant, wolves may occasionally [[surplus killing|surplus kill]]. Such instances are common in domestic animals, but rare in the wild. In the wild, surplus killing primarily occurs during late winter or spring, when snow is unusually deep (thus impeding the movements of prey)<ref>{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=144}}</ref> or during the denning period, when wolves require a ready supply of meat when denbound.<ref name="l54">{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|pp=54–55}}</ref> Medium-sized prey are especially vulnerable to surplus killing, as the swift throat-biting method by which they are killed allows wolves to quickly kill one animal and move on to another.<ref name="z217" /> Surplus killing may also occur when adult wolves are teaching their young to hunt.<ref name="g67">{{Harvnb|Graves|2007|p=67}}</ref>

Once prey is brought down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and tugging at the carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it.<ref name="mech185">{{Harvnb|Mech|1981|p=185}}</ref> The breeding pair typically monopolizes food in order to continue producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done at the expense of other family members, especially non-pups.<ref name="m58">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=58}}</ref> The breeding pair typically eats first, though as it is they who usually work the hardest in killing prey, they may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat unmolested. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey, such as the [[heart]], [[liver]], [[lungs]] and [[stomach]] lining. The [[kidneys]] and [[spleen]] are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the [[muscle]]s.<ref name="m123">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=122–5}}</ref> A single wolf can eat 15–19% of its body weight in a single feeding.<ref name="m201">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=201}}</ref>

The gray wolf's expressive behavior is more complex than that of the coyote and golden jackal, as necessitated by its group living and hunting habits.

Passive submission usually occurs as a reaction to the approach of a [[dominance (ethology)|dominant animal]], and consists of the submissive wolf lying partly on its back and allowing the dominant wolf to sniff its [[anogenital area]]. Active submission occurs often as a form of greeting, and involves the submissive wolf approaching another in a low posture, and licking the other wolf's face.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=93}}</ref> When wolves are together, they commonly indulge in behaviors such as nose pushing, jaw wrestling, cheek rubbing and facial licking.

====Howling====
{{Listen|filename=Wolf howls.ogg|title=Wolves howling|format=[[Ogg]]}}
{{Listen|filename=rallying.ogg|title=Rallying cry|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Wolves howl to assemble the pack (usually before and after hunts), to pass on an alarm (particularly at a den site), to locate each other during a storm or unfamiliar territory and to communicate across great distances.<ref name="l38" /> Wolf howls can under certain conditions be heard over areas of up to {{convert|130|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="f496">{{Harvnb|Feldhamer|Thompson|Chapman|2003|p=496}}</ref> Wolf howls are generally indistinguishable from those of large dogs.<ref name="ern770">{{Harvnb|Seton|1909|p=770}}</ref> Male wolves give voice through an [[octave]], passing to a deep [[Bass (sound)|bass]] with a stress on "''O''", while females produce a modulated nasal [[baritone]] with stress on "''U''". Pups almost never howl, while yearling wolves produce howls ending in a series of dog-like yelps.<ref name="s262">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=262}}</ref> Howling consists of a fundamental frequency which may lie between 150 and 780&nbsp;Hz, and consists of up to 12 harmonically related overtones. The pitch usually remains constant or varies smoothly, and may change direction as many as four or five times.<ref name="mech" /> Howls used for calling pack mates to a kill are long, smooth sounds similar to the beginning of the cry of a [[horned owl]]. When pursuing prey, they emit a higher pitched howl, vibrating on two notes. When closing in on their prey, they emit a combination of a short bark and a howl.<ref name="ern770" /> When howling together, wolves harmonize rather than chorus on the same note, thus creating the illusion of there being more wolves than there actually are.<ref name="l38">{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|p=38}}</ref> Lone wolves typically avoid howling in areas where other packs are present.<ref name="m16">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=16}}</ref> Wolves do not respond to howls in rainy weather and when satiated.<ref name="s262" /> Wolves from different geographic locations may howl in different fashions: the howls of European wolves are much more protracted and melodious than those of North American wolves, whose howls are louder and have a stronger emphasis on the first syllable. The two are however [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]], as North American wolves have been recorded to respond to European-style howls made by biologists.<ref name="z73">{{Harvnb|Zimen|1981|p=73}}</ref>

====Other vocalizations====
Other vocalisations of wolves are usually divided into three categories: growls, barks and whines.<ref name="l39">{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|pp=39–41}}</ref> Barking has a fundamental frequency between 320–904&nbsp;Hz,<ref name="mech" /> and is usually emitted by startled wolves. Wolves do not bark as loudly or continuously as dogs do, but bark a few times and retreat from perceived danger.<ref name="l39" /> Growling has a fundamental frequency of 380–450&nbsp;Hz,<ref name="mech" /> and is usually emitted during food challenges. Pups commonly growl when playing. One variation of the howl is accompanied by a high pitched whine, which precedes a lunging attack.<ref name="l38" /> Whining is associated with situations of anxiety, curiosity, inquiry and intimacy such as greeting, feeding pups and playing.<ref name="l39" />

===Olfactory===
{{see also|Urine marking#Canidae}}
[[File:Lobo marcando su territorio.jpg|thumb|Wolf [[Spraying (animal behavior)|marking its territory]], [[Kolmården]] Zoo. [[Raised leg urination]] (RLU) is considered the most important form of scent communication in the wolf, making up 60–80% of all scent marks observed.<ref>{{cite pmid|1200478}}</ref>]]
[[Olfaction]] is probably the wolf's most acute sense, and plays a fundamental role in communication. The wolf has a large number of [[apocrine sweat gland]]s on the face, lips, back, and between the toes. The odor produced by these glands varies according to the individual wolf's [[microflora]] and diet, giving each a distinct "odor fingerprint". A combination of apocrine and [[eccrine sweat gland]]s on the feet allows the wolf to deposit its scent whilst scratching the ground, which usually occurs after [[urine marking]] and defecation during the [[breeding season]]. The [[Hair follicle|follicle]]s present on the guard hairs from the wolf's back have clusters of apocrine and [[sebaceous gland]]s at their bases. As the skin on the back is usually folded, this provides a [[microclimate]] for bacterial propagation around the glands. During piloerection, the guard hairs on the back are raised and the skin folds spread, thus releasing scent.<ref name="m80">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=80–86}}</ref> The [[pre-caudal scent glands]] may play a role in expressing aggression, as combative wolves raise the base of their tails whilst drooping the tip, thus positioning the [[scent gland]]s at the highest point.<ref name="ern773">{{Harvnb|Seton|1909|p=773}}</ref> The wolf possesses a pair of [[anal sac]]s beneath the rectum, which contain both apocrine and sebaceous glands. The components of anal sac secretions vary according to season and gender, thus indicating that the secretions provide information related to [[gender]] and reproductive state. The secretions of the [[preputial gland]]s may advertise hormonal condition or social position, as dominant wolves have been observed to stand over subordinates, apparently presenting [[Canine reproductive system|the genital area]] for investigation,<ref name="m80" /> which may include genital licking.<ref>Fox, M. W. [http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1379064 "The Social Significance of Genital Licking in the Wolf, Canis lupus."] Journal of Mammalogy (1972): 637-640.</ref> During the breeding season, female wolves secrete [[vaginal secretion|substances from the vagina]] which communicate the females' reproductive state, and can be detected by males from long distances. [[Urine marking]] is the best-studied means of [[olfactory communication]] in wolves. Its exact function is debated, though most researchers agree that its primary purpose is to establish boundaries. Wolves urine mark more frequently and vigorously in unfamiliar areas, or areas of intrusion, where the scent of other wolves or canids is present. So-called raised leg urination (RLU) is more common in male wolves than in females, and may serve the purpose of maximizing the possibility of detection by conspecifics, as well as reflect the height of the marking wolf. Only dominant wolves typically use RLU, with subordinate males continuing to use the juvenile standing posture throughout adulthood.<ref name="m80" />{{clear}}

===Diet===
[[File:Wolf with Caribou Hindquarter.jpg|thumb|[[Northwestern wolf]] (''C. l. occidentalis'') carrying [[caribou]] hindquarter, [[Denali National Park]]]]
The gray wolf generally specializes in vulnerable individuals of large prey.<ref name="f492">{{Harvnb|Feldhamer|Thompson|Chapman|2003|p=492}}</ref> In Eurasia, many wolf populations are forced to subsist largely on [[livestock]] and [[waste|garbage]] in areas with dense human activity, though wild ungulates such as [[moose]], [[red deer]], [[roe deer]] and [[wild boar]] are still the most important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. Other prey species include [[reindeer]], [[argali]], [[mouflon]], [[wisent]], [[saiga]], [[ibex]], [[chamois]], [[wild goat]]s, [[fallow deer]] and [[musk deer]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=107}}</ref> The prey animals of North American wolves have largely continued to occupy suitable habitats with low human density, and cases of wolves subsisting largely on garbage or livestock are exceptional. Animals preferred as prey by North American wolves include moose, [[white-tailed deer]], [[elk]], [[mule deer]], [[bighorn sheep]], [[Dall's sheep]], [[American bison]], [[muskox]] and [[caribou]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=109}}</ref>

Although wolves primarily feed on medium to large sized [[ungulate]]s, they are not fussy eaters. Smaller sized animals that may supplement the diet of wolves include [[marmot]]s, [[hare]]s, [[badger]]s, [[fox]]es, [[weasel]]s, [[ground squirrel]]s, [[mice]], [[hamster]]s, [[vole]]s and other [[rodent]]s, as well as [[insectivore]]s. They frequently eat [[waterfowl]] and their [[egg (biology)|eggs]]. When such foods are insufficient, they prey on [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s, [[frog]]s, rarely [[toad]]s and large [[insect]]s as available.

Wolves supplement their diet with fruit and vegetable matter: they willingly eat the [[berries]] of [[Sorbus|mountain ash]], [[lily of the valley]], [[bilberries]], [[blueberries]] and [[cowberry]].

Wolves typically dominate other [[canid]] species in areas where they both occur. In North America, incidents of wolves killing [[coyote]]s are common, particularly in winter, when coyotes feed on wolf kills. Wolves may attack coyote den sites, digging out and killing their pups, though rarely eating them.

[[File:Ursus arctos, Canis lupus - Juraparc, Vallorbe, Vaud, Switzerland - 20090822.jpg|thumb|Wolf barking at a [[brown bear]] in Juraparc, [[Vallorbe]], Vaud, [[Switzerland]]]]
Wolves encounter [[brown bear]]s in both Eurasia and North America. Brown bears typically dominate wolf packs in disputes over carcasses, while wolf packs mostly prevail against bears when defending their den sites. Both species kill each other's young. Wolves eat the brown bears they kill, while brown bears seem to only eat young wolves.<ref name="m261">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=261–63}}</ref> [[American black bear]]s occur solely in the Americas. Wolf interactions with black bears are much rarer than with brown bears, due to differences in habitat preferences. The majority of black bear encounters with wolves occur in the species' northern range, with no interactions being recorded in Mexico. Wolves have been recorded on numerous occasions to actively seek out black bears in their dens and kill them without eating them. Unlike brown bears, black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills.<ref name="m263">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=263–64}}</ref> While encounters with brown and black bears appear to be common, [[polar bear]]s are rarely encountered by wolves, though there are two records of wolf packs killing polar bear cubs.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic59-3-322.pdf |title=Wolf (Canis lupus) Predation of a Polar Bear (Ursus maritimus) Cub on the Sea Ice off Northwestern Banks Island, Northwest Territories, Canada|journal=Arctic|volume=59|issue=3|year=2006|pages=322–324 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-16}}</ref> Wolves also kill the cubs of [[Asian black bear]]s.<ref name="s730">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=730}}</ref>

Wolves may encounter [[striped hyena]]s in [[Israel]] and Central Asia, usually in disputes over carcasses.

Large wolf populations limit the numbers of small to medium sized [[Felinae|felines]]. Wolves encounter [[cougar]]s along portions of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and adjacent mountain ranges. Wolves and cougars typically avoid encountering each other by hunting on different elevations. In winter however, when snow accumulation forces their prey into valleys, interactions between the two species become more likely.

Other than humans, [[tiger]]s appear to be the only serious predators of wolves.<ref name="WoT" /><ref name="l29" /><ref name="s255" /><ref name="Mech 2003 265" /><ref name="ussr" /> In areas where wolves and tigers share ranges, such as the [[Russian Far East]], the two species typically display a great deal of dietary overlap, resulting in intense competition. Wolf and tiger interactions are well documented in [[Sikhote-Alin]] which, until the beginning of the 20th century, held very few wolves. Wolf numbers increased in the region only after tigers were largely eliminated during the Russian colonization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This is corroborated by native inhabitants of the region claiming that they had no memory of wolves inhabiting Sikohte-Alin until the 1930s, when tiger numbers decreased. Tigers depress wolf numbers, either to the point of [[local extinction|localized extinction]] or to such low numbers as to make them a functionally insignificant component of the [[ecosystem]]. Wolves appear capable of escaping [[competitive exclusion]] from tigers only when human persecution decreases tiger numbers. Today, wolves are considered scarce in tiger inhabited areas, being found in scattered pockets, and usually seen traveling as loners or in small groups. First hand accounts on interactions between the two species indicate that tigers occasionally chase wolves from their kills, while wolves [[scavenge]] from tiger kills. Proven cases of tigers killing wolves are rare and attacks appear to be competitive rather than predatory in nature, with at least four proven records of tigers killing wolves without consuming them.<ref>Miquelle, D.G., Stephens, P.A., Smirnov, E.N., Goodrich, J.M., Zaumyslova, O.Yu. & Myslenkov, A.I.

{{See also|History of wolves in Yellowstone|Wolves in Great Britain|Wolves in Ireland}}
[[File:Wolf distr.gif|thumb|400px|Present and past distribution of the gray wolf (not including the newly discovered wolf populations in Ethiopia, Egypt, Senegal, Mali and Algeria)]]

The gray wolf was once one of the world's most widely distributed mammals, after humans and [[lion]]s,<ref name="f483">{{Harvnb|Feldhamer|Thompson|Chapman|2003|p=483}}</ref> living throughout the northern hemisphere north of 15°N latitude in [[North America]] and 12°N in [[India]]. After the extinction of the lion in the Americas and most of Eurasia at the end of the Pleistocene Ice Age, the wolf possessed the greatest natural range of any living terrestrial animal other than humans in historic times.<ref>Nowak, Ronald M; and Paradiso, John L. Walker's Mammals of the World. 4th ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; 1983. p952</ref> However, deliberate human persecution has reduced the species' range to about one third, due to livestock predation and fear over attacks on humans. The species is now extinct in much of [[Western Europe]], in [[Mexico]] and much of the [[USA]]. In modern times, the gray wolf occurs mostly in wilderness and remote areas, particularly in [[Canada]], [[Alaska]] and northern USA, [[Northern Europe|Europe]], and [[Northern Asia|Asia]] from about 75°N to 12°N.<ref name="iucn" />

Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s, and have fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range, due to legal protection, changes in land-use and rural human population shifts to cities. Competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the species. Despite these threats, the gray wolf's relatively widespread range and stable population means that the species is not threatened at a global level, and is therefore classified by the [[IUCN]] as [[Least Concern]].<ref name="iucn" />

===Europe===

====Decline====
[[File:Men of the old stone age (1915) Wolf.png|thumb|left|[[Polychrome]] [[cave painting]] of a wolf, [[Font-de-Gaume]], France.]] 
The extermination of [[Northern Europe]]'s wolves first became an organized effort during the [[Middle Ages]], and continued until the late 1800s. In [[England]], wolf persecution was enforced by [[legislation]], and the last wolf was killed in the early sixteenth century during the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. Wolves lasted longer in [[Scotland]], where they sheltered in vast tracts of forest, which were subsequently burned down. Wolves managed to survive in the forests of [[Braemar]] and [[Sutherland]] until 1684. The extirpation of wolves in [[Ireland]] followed a similar course, with the last wolf believed to have been killed in 1786.<ref>http://www.nuigalway.ie/geography/documents/wolf.pdf</ref> A wolf bounty was introduced in [[Sweden]] in 1647, after the extermination of moose and reindeer forced wolves to feed on livestock. The [[Sami people|Sami]] extirpated wolves in northern Sweden in organized drives. By 1960, few wolves remained in Sweden, due to the use of snowmobiles in hunting them, with the last specimen being killed in 1966. The gray wolf was exterminated in [[Denmark]] in 1772 and [[Norway]]'s last wolf was killed in 1973. The species was decimated in 20th century [[Finland]], despite regular dispersals from [[Russia]]. The gray wolf was only present in the eastern and northern parts of Finland by 1900, though its numbers increased after [[World War II]].<ref name="m318">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=318–320}}</ref>

In [[Central Europe]], wolves were dramatically reduced in number during the early nineteenth century, due to organized hunts and reductions in ungulate populations.  In [[Bavaria]], the last wolf was killed in 1847, and had disappeared from the [[Rhine]] regions by 1899<ref name="m318" /> and largely disappeared in [[Switzerland]] before the end of the nineteenth century. In 1934, [[Nazi Germany]] became the first state in modern history to place the wolf under protection, though the species was already extirpated in Germany at this point.<ref>Sax, Boria (2000). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=T5aN5S6AhXQC&printsec=frontcover Animals in the Third Reich: Pets, Scapegoats, and the Holocaust]'', Continuum International Publishing Group, p. 75, ISBN 0826412890</ref> The last free-living wolf to be killed on the soil of present-day Germany before 1945 was the so-called "[[Tiger of Sabrodt]]", which was shot near [[Hoyerswerda]], [[Lusatia]] (then [[Lower Silesia]]) in 1904. Today, wolves have returned to the area.<ref>''[http://www.wolfsregion-lausitz.de/verbreitung/verbreitung-in-deutschland Verbreitung in Deutschland]'' [http://www.wolfsregion-lausitz.de/verbreitung/verbreitung-in-deutschland  at Wolf Region Lausitz]. Retrieved on 12 Oct 2013</ref> Wolf hunting in [[France]] was first institutionalized by [[Charlemagne]] between 800–813, when he established the ''louveterie'', a special corps of wolf hunters. The ''louveterie'' was abolished after the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, but was re-established in 1814. In 1883, up to 1,386 wolves were killed, with many more by poison.<ref name="m318" />

[[File:Last wolf in Central Finland.jpg|thumb|Last wolf to be killed in central [[Finland]] ([[Karstula]], 1911).]]
In [[Eastern Europe]], wolves were never fully exterminated, due to the area's contiguity with Asia and its large forested areas. However, Eastern European wolf populations were reduced to very low numbers by the late nineteenth century. Wolves were extirpated in [[Slovakia]] during the first decade of the twentieth century and, by the mid-twentieth century, could only be found in a few forested areas in eastern [[Poland]]. Wolves in the eastern [[Balkans]] benefitted from the region's contiguity with the [[former Soviet Union]] and large areas of plains, mountains and farmlands. Wolves in [[Hungary]] occurred in only half the country around the start of the 20th century, and were largely restricted to the [[Carpathian Basin]]. Wolf populations in [[Romania]] remained largely substantial, with an average of 2,800 wolves being killed annually out of a population of 4,600 from 1955–1965. An all time low was reached in 1967, when the population was reduced to 1,550 animals. The extermination of wolves in [[Bulgaria]] was relatively recent, as a previous population of about 1,000 animals in 1955 was reduced to about 100–200 in 1964. In [[Greece]], the species disappeared from the southern [[Peloponnese]] in 1930. Despite periods of intense hunting during the eighteenth century, wolves never disappeared in the western Balkans, from [[Albania]] to the [[former Yugoslavia]]. Organized persecution of wolves began in Yugoslavia in 1923, with the setting up of the Wolf Extermination Committee (WEC) in [[Kocevje]], [[Slovenia]]. The WEC was successful in reducing wolf numbers in the [[Dinaric Alps]].<ref name="m318" />

In [[Southern Europe]], wolf extermination was not as complete as in Northern Europe, due to greater cultural tolerance of the species. Wolf populations only began declining in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the early 19th-century, and was reduced by a half of its original size by 1900. Wolf bounties were regularly paid in [[Italy]] as late as 1950. Wolves were exterminated in the [[alps]] by 1800, and numbered only 100 by 1973, inhabiting only 3–5% of their former Italian range.<ref name="m318" />

====Recovery====
[[File:Wolves in Norway.jpg|thumb|left|Wolves in [[Bardu]], [[Troms]], [[Norway]]]]
The recovery of European wolf populations began after the 1950s, when traditional pastoral and rural economies declined and thus removed the need to heavily persecute wolves. By the 1980s, small and isolated wolf populations expanded in the wake of decreased human density in rural areas and the recovery of wild prey populations.<ref name="m324">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=324–326}}</ref>

The gray wolf has been fully protected in [[Italy]] since 1976, and now holds a population of 450–500 animals, which has an annual increase of about 60%. Italian wolves entered [[France]]'s [[Mercantour National Park]] in 1993, and at least fifty wolves were discovered in the western [[Alps]] in 2000. By 2013 the 250 wolves in the [[Western Alps]] imposed a significant burden on traditional [[sheep]] and [[goat]] husbandry with a loss of over 5,000 animals in 2012.<ref name="NYT90313">{{cite news|title=As Wolves Return to French Alps, a Way of Life Is Threatened|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/04/world/europe/as-wolves-return-to-french-alps-a-way-of-life-is-threatened.html|accessdate=September 4, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 3, 2013|author=Scott Sayare|quote=sheep and goat losses doubled in the past five years to nearly 6,000 in 2012}}</ref> There are approximately 2000 wolves inhabiting the [[Iberian Peninsula]], of which 150 reside in northeastern [[Portugal]]. In [[Spain]], the species occurs in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Province of León|Leon]], and [[Asturia]]. Although hundreds of Iberian wolves are illegally killed annually, the population has expanded south across the river [[Duero]] and east to the [[Asturias]] and [[Pyrenees Mountains]].<ref name="m324" />

In 1978, wolves began recolonising central [[Sweden]] after a twelve-year absence, and have since expanded into southern [[Norway]]. As of 2005, the total number of Swedish and Norwegian wolves is estimated to be at least one hundred, including eleven [[breeding pair]]s. The gray wolf is fully protected in Sweden and partially controlled in Norway. The Scandinavian wolf populations owe their continued existence to neighbouring [[Finland]]'s contiguity with the [[Republic of Karelia]], which houses a large population of wolves. Wolves in Finland are protected only in the southern third of the country, and can be hunted in other areas during specific seasons,<ref name="m324" /> though poaching remains common, with 90% of young wolf deaths being due to human predation, and the number of wolves killed exceeds the number of hunting licenses, in some areas by a factor of two. Furthermore, the decline in the moose populations has reduced the wolf's food supply.<ref name="SL2008">{{fi}} Juha Kauppinen, [http://vanha.suomenluonto.fi/artikkeli-391.html "Susien määrä yllättäen vähentynyt"], ''Suomen Luonto'', April 2008.</ref><ref name="IL2013">{{fi}} [http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2013031916799328_uu.shtml "SS: Kuolleissa susissa vanhoja hauleja"], ''[[Iltalehti]]'', March 19, 2013.</ref>

Wolf populations in [[Poland]] have increased to about 800–900 individuals since being classified as a game species in 1976. Poland plays a fundamental role in providing routes of expansion into neighbouring [[Central Europe]]an countries. In the east, its range overlaps with populations in [[Lithuania]], [[Belorussia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Slovakia]]. A population in western Poland expanded into eastern [[Germany]] and in 2000 the first cubs were born on German territory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wolves in Germany|author=Friedrich, Regina |others=Translated by Kevin White|url=http://www.goethe.de/ges/mol/del/pan/en5715614.htm|publisher=[[Goethe-Institut|Goethe-Institut e.

Although wolves have special status in Hungary, they may be hunted with a year-round permit if they cause problems.<ref name="m324" />

[[Romania]] has a large population of wolves, numbering 2500 animals. The wolf has been a protected animal in Romania since 1996, although the law is not enforced. The number of wolves in [[Albania]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] is largely unknown, despite the importance the two countries have in linking wolf populations from [[Greece]] to those of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and Croatia. Although protected, many wolves are illegally killed in Greece annually, and their future is uncertain. Wolf numbers have declined in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1986, while the species is fully protected in neighbouring Croatia and [[Slovenia]].<ref name="m324" />

Since 2011, Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark have also reported wolf sightings presumably by natural migration from adjacent countries.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/news/christmas/21568656-after-millennia-spent-exterminating-them-humanity-protecting-wolves-numbers-have-risen "The wolf returns: Call of the wild"], ''[[The Economist]]'', (Dec. 22, 2012)</ref><ref>[http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/Nyheder/2012/DetVarEnUlv.htm "Det var en ulv"], (in Danish) Danish Nature Agency, (Dec. 7, 2012)</ref>

====Historical range and decline====
[[File:Honshu-wolf statue.jpg|thumb|Monument to the last Japanese wolf, [[Nara Prefecture]], [[Japan]]]]
During the 19th century, wolves were widespread in many parts of the [[Holy Land]] east and west of the [[Jordan River]]. However, they decreased considerably in number between 1964 and 1980, largely due to persecution by farmers.<ref>Qumsiyeh, Mazin B. (1996), ''Mammals of the Holy Land'', Texas Tech University Press, pp. 146–148, ISBN 089672364X</ref> The species was not considered common in northern and central [[Saudi Arabia]] during the 19th century, with most early publications involving animals either from southwestern [[Asir]], northern rocky areas bordering Jodan, or areas surrounding [[Riyadh]].<ref name="arabia">{{cite journal | last1 = Cunningham | first1 = P.

The wolf's range in the [[Soviet Union]] encompassed nearly the entire territory of the country, being absent only on the [[Solovetsky Islands]], [[Franz-Josef Land]], [[Severnaya Zemlya]], and the [[Karaginsky Island|Karagin]], [[Commander Islands|Commander]] and [[Shantar Islands]]. The species was exterminated twice in [[Crimea]], once after the [[Russian Civil War]], and again after [[World War II]].<ref name="s177">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=177–178}}</ref> Following the two world wars, Soviet wolf populations peaked twice. 30,000 wolves were harvested annually out of a population of 200,000 during the 1940s, with 40,000–50,000 harvested during peak years. Soviet wolf populations reached a low around 1970, disappearing over much of [[European Russia]]. The population increased again by 1980 to about 75,000, with 32,000 being killed in 1979.<ref name="m327" /> Wolf populations in northern [[inner Mongolia]] declined during the 1940s, primarily due to poaching of [[Mongolian gazelle|gazelle]]s, the wolf's main prey.<ref name="m320">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2005|p=320}}</ref> In [[British Raj|British-ruled India]], wolves were heavily persecuted due to their attacks on sheep, goats and children. In 1876, 2,825 wolves were bountied in the [[North-Western Provinces]] (NWP) and [[Bihar]]. By the 1920s, wolf extermination remained a priority in the NWP and [[Awadh]]. Overall, over 100,000 wolves were killed for bounties in British India between 1871 and 1916.<ref>Knight, John (2004). ''Wildlife in Asia: Cultural Perspectives'', Psychology Press, pp. 219–221, ISBN 0700713328</ref>

Wolves in [[Japan]] became extinct during the [[Meiji restoration]] period, an extermination known as ''ōkami no kujo''. The wolf was deemed a threat to ranching which the Meiji government promoted at the time, and targeted via a bounty system and a direct chemical extermination campaign inspired by the similar contemporary American campaign. The last Japanese wolf was a male killed on the 23 January 1905 near Washikaguchi (now called Higashi Yoshiro).<ref name="w">{{Harvnb|Walker|2005|p=}}</ref>

There is little reliable data on the status of wolves in the [[Middle East]], save for those in [[Israel]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], though their numbers appear to be stable, and are likely to remain so. Israel's conservation policies and effective law enforcement maintain a moderately sized wolf population, which radiates into neighbouring countries, while Saudi Arabia has vast tracts of desert, where about 300–600 wolves live undisturbed.<ref name="m326">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=326–327}}</ref> The wolf survives throughout most of its historical range in Saudi Arabia, probably due to a lack of pastoralism and abundant human waste.<ref name="arabia" /> [[Turkey]] may play an important role in maintaining wolves in the region, due to its contiguity with Central Asia. The mountains of Turkey have served as a refuge for the few wolves remaining in [[Syria]]. A small wolf population occurs in the [[Golan Heights]], and is well protected by the military activities there. Wolves living in the southern [[Negev]] desert are contiguous with populations living in the [[Egypt]]ian [[Sinai]] and [[Jordan]]. Throughout the Middle East, the species is only protected in Israel. Elsewhere, it can be hunted year-round by [[Bedouin]]s.<ref name="m326" />

Little is known of current wolf populations in [[Iran]], which once occurred throughout the country in low densities during the mid-1970s. The northern regions of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] are important strongholds for the wolf. It has been estimated that there are about 300 wolves in approximately {{convert|60,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in northern [[India]], and 50 more in [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Overall, India supports about 800-3,000 wolves, scattered among several remnant populations. Although protected since 1972, Indian wolves are classed as Endangered, with many populations lingering in low numbers or living in areas increasingly used by humans. Although present in [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]], there is no information of wolves occurring there.<ref name="m327">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=327}}</ref>

Wolf populations throughout [[Northern Asia|Northern]] and [[Central Asia]] are largely unknown, but are estimated in the hundreds of thousands based on annual harvests. Since the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], continent-wide extermination of wolves has ceased, and wolf populations have increased to about 25,000–30,000 animals throughout the [[former Soviet Union]]. In [[China]] and [[Mongolia]], wolves are only protected in reserves. Mongolian populations have been estimated at 10,000–30,000, while the status of wolves in China is more fragmentary. The north has a declining population of an estimated 400 wolves, while [[Xinjiang]] and [[Tibet]] hold about 10,000 and 2,000 respectively.<ref name="m328">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=327–328}}</ref>

===North America===

====Historical range and decline====
Originally, the gray wolf occupied all of North America north of about 20°N. It occurred all over the mainland, save for the southeastern [[USA]], [[California]] west of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and the tropical and subtropical areas of [[Mexico]]. Large continental islands occupied by wolves included [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Vancouver Island]], southeastern Alaskan islands, and throughout the [[Arctic Archipelago]] and [[Greenland]].<ref name="f483" />

The decline of North American wolf populations coincided with increasing human populations and the expansion of agriculture. By the start of the 20th century, the species had almost disappeared from the eastern USA, excepting some areas of the [[Appalachians]] and the northwestern [[Great Lakes Region]]. In [[Canada]], the gray wolf was extirpated in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] between 1870 and 1921, and in Newfoundland around 1911. It vanished from the southern regions of [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]] between 1850 and 1900. The gray wolf's decline in the prairies began with the extermination of the [[American bison]] and other ungulates in the 1860s–70s. From 1900–1930, the gray wolf was virtually eliminated from the western USA and adjoining parts of Canada, due to intensive predator control programs aimed at eradicating the species. The gray wolf was exterminated by federal and state governments from all of the USA by 1960, except in Alaska and northern [[Minnesota]]. The decline in North American wolf populations was reversed from the 1930s to the early 1950s, particularly in southwestern Canada, due to expanding ungulate populations resulting from improved regulation of big game hunting. This increase triggered a resumption of wolf control in western and northern Canada. Thousands of wolves were killed from the early 1950s to the early 1960s, mostly due to poisoning. This campaign was halted and wolf populations increased again by the mid-1970s.<ref name="f483" />
[[File:Mexican Wolf 2 yfb-edit 2.jpg|thumb|Captive [[Mexican wolf]] at [[Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge]], [[New Mexico]]]]

====Modern range====
The species' modern range in North America is mostly confined to Alaska and Canada, with populations also occurring in northern Minnesota, northern [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]]'s [[Upper Peninsula]], and portions of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]], northern [[Oregon]], and [[Montana]]. Canadian wolves began to naturally re-colonize northern Montana around [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] in 1979, and the first wolf den in the western U.S. in over half a century was documented there in 1986.<ref name=EIS>{{cite report |title=The Reintroduction of Gray Wolves to Yellowstone National Park and Central Idaho: Final Environmental Impact Report |publisher=USFWS |year=1994 |url=http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/mammals/wolf/eis_1994.pdf |accessdate=2014-02-09 }}</ref> The wolf population in northwest Montana initially grew as a result of natural reproduction and dispersal to about 48 wolves by the end of 1994.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gray Wolf History |publisher=Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks |url=http://fwp.mt.gov/fishAndWildlife/management/wolf/history.html |accessdate=2014-02-09 }}</ref> From 1995 to 1996, wolves from [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]] were reintroduced to [[Yellowstone National Park]] and Idaho. In addition, the Mexican wolf (''Canis lupus baileyi'') was reintroduced to [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] in 1998. The gray wolf is found in approximately 80% of its historical range in Canada, thus making it an important stronghold for the species.<ref name="f483" />

Canada is home to about 52,000–60,000 wolves, whose legal status varies according to [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province and territory]]. [[First Nations]] residents may hunt wolves without restriction, and some provinces require licenses for residents to hunt wolves while others do not. In [[Alberta]], wolves on private land may be baited and hunted by the landowner without requiring a license, and in some areas, wolf hunting bounty programs exist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albertaregulations.ca/huntingregs/genregs.html|title=Alberta Hunting Regulations|author=Government of Alberta.|accessdate=2013-07-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://albertawilderness.ca/news/2013/2103-03-27-awa-news-release-alberta-government-has-lost-control-of-wolf-management|title=2013-03-27 AWA News Release: Alberta Government has Lost Control of Wolf Management|accessdate=2013-07-02}}</ref> Large-scale wolf population control through poisoning, trapping and aerial hunting is also presently conducted by government-mandated programs in order to support populations of endangered prey species such as [[Boreal woodland caribou|Woodland caribou]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/alberta_canada_energy_boom_places_wolves_in_the_crosshairs/2459/|title=Killing Wolves: A Product of Alberta’s Big Oil and Gas Boom|author=Struzik, Ed|accessdate=2013-07-02}}</ref> In Eastern Canada, grey wolves have hybridized with [[coyotes]] to produce [[Coywolf|"coywolves"]], posing management challenges.

In Alaska, the gray wolf population is estimated at 6,000–7,000, and can be legally harvested during hunting and trapping seasons, with [[bag limits]] and other restrictions. As of 2002, there are 250 wolves in 28 packs in Yellowstone, and 260 wolves in 25 packs in Idaho. The gray wolf received [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA) protection in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan in 1974, and was re-classed from [[Endangered]] to [[Threatened]] in 2003.

Reintroduced [[Mexican wolves]] in Arizona and New Mexico are protected under the ESA and, as of late 2002, number 28 individuals in eight packs.<ref name="m321">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=321–324}}</ref>

===Africa===
Up until 2011, it was debated whether or not the gray wolf occurred in [[Africa]]. [[Aristotle]] wrote of wolves living in [[Egypt]], mentioning that they were smaller than the Greek kind. [[Georg Ebers]] wrote of the wolf being among the sacred animals of Egypt, describing it as a "smaller variety" of wolf to those of Europe, and noting how the name [[Lykopolis]], the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian city dedicated to [[Anubis]], means "city of the wolf". Zoologist [[Ernst Schwarz]] classified North Africa's wolf-like canid as a subspecies of [[golden jackal]], and was subsequently criticised for having overlooked its morphological affinity to the gray wolf.<ref name="Rueness2011" /><ref name="ferg">{{Cite journal|author=Ferguson, W.W.|year= 1981|title= The systematic of ''Canis aureus lupaster'' (Carnivora : Canidae) and the occurrence of ''Canis lupus'' in North Africa, Egypt and Sinai|journal= Mammalia |volume=4|pages= 459–465}}</ref> In December 2002, a canid was sighted in [[Eritrea]]'s  [[Danakil Desert]], whose appearance didn't correspond to that of the golden jackal or the six other recognised species of the area, but strongly resembled that of the gray wolf.<ref name="eritrea">{{cite journal | last1 = Tiwari | first1 = J.

The results suggested that African wolves inhabit at least two places in [[Ethiopia]], approximately 2,500&nbsp;km southeast of Egypt.<ref name="Rueness2011" /> A further study confirmed the presence of wolves in [[Algeria]], [[Mali]] and [[Senegal]].<ref name="gaubert" />

==Diseases and parasites==
Because wolves travel great distances, they may play an important role in spreading and maintaining diseases in certain areas, some of which can be potentially fatal to humans. However, most gray wolf populations are remarkably resilient against outbreaks, for there are no records of wolves being decimated by disease. Usually, a wolf displaying the first symptoms of disease leaves its pack, thus preventing the sickness from spreading to its pack mates.<ref name="g77">{{Harvnb|Graves|2007|pp=77–85}}</ref>

===Viral and bacterial infections===
[[Viral disease]]s carried by wolves include [[rabies]], [[canine distemper]], [[canine parvovirus]], [[infectious canine hepatitis]], [[papillomatosis]], and [[canine coronavirus]].<ref name="m208">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=208–211}}</ref> Wolves are a major host for rabies in [[Russia]], [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and [[India]].<ref name="g77" /> In wolves, the [[incubation period]] is 8–21 days, and results in the host becoming agitated, deserting its pack, and travelling up to 80&nbsp;km a day, thus increasing the risk of infecting other wolves. Infected wolves do not show any fear of humans, with most documented wolf attacks on people being attributed to rabid animals. Although canine distemper is lethal in dogs, it has not been recorded to kill wolves, except in Canada and Alaska. The canine parvovirus, which causes death by [[dehydration]], [[electrolyte imbalance]], and [[endotoxin|endotoxic]] shock or [[sepsis]], is largely surviveable in wolves, but can be lethal to pups. Wolves may catch infectious canine hepatitis from dogs, though there are no records of wolves dying from it. Papillomatosis has been recorded only once in wolves, and likely doesn't cause serious illness or death, though it may alter feeding behaviors. The canine coronavirus has been recorded in Alaskan wolves, with infections being most prevalent in winter months.<ref name="m208" />

[[Bacterial diseases]] carried by wolves include [[brucellosis]], [[lyme disease]], [[leptospirosis]], [[tularemia]], [[bovine tuberculosis]],<ref name="m211">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=211–213}}</ref> [[listeriosis]], [[anthrax]] and [[foot and mouth disease]].<ref name="g77" /> Wolves can catch ''[[Brucella suis]]'' from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves tend not to show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, it does not appear to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause [[fever]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], vomiting, [[anemia]], [[hematuria]], [[Jaundice|icterus]], and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably due to prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.<ref name="m211" />

===Parasitic infections===
Wolves carry [[ectoparasite]]s and [[endoparasite]]s, with wolves in the former [[Soviet Union]] having been recorded to carry at least 50 species.<ref name="g77" /> Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more serious in sick or malnourished specimens.<ref name="m202">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202–208}}</ref> [[Parasitic infection]] in wolves is of particular concern to people, as wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.<ref name="g77" />

Wolves are often infested with a variety of [[arthropod]] exoparasites, including [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s, [[lice]], and [[mite]]s. The most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]'' (or mange mite),<ref name="m202" /> though they rarely develop full blown [[mange]], unlike foxes.<ref name="s254">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=254–55}}</ref> Lice, such as ''Trichodectes canis'', may cause sickness in wolves, but rarely death. Ticks of the genus ''[[Ixodes]]'' can infect wolves with [[Lyme disease]] and [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]].<ref name="m202" /> The tick ''[[Dermacentor]] pictus'' also infests wolves. Other ectoparasites include biting lice, [[sucking lice]] and the fleas ''[[Pulex irritans]]'' and ''[[Ctenocephalides canis]]''.<ref name="s254" />

Endoparasites known to infect wolves include [[protozoan]]s and [[helminth]]s ([[Trematoda|fluke]]s, [[tapeworm]]s, [[roundworm]]s and [[thorny-headed worm]]s). Of 30,000 protozoan species, only a few have been recorded to infect wolves: ''[[Isospora]]'', ''[[Toxoplasma]]'', ''[[Sarcocystis]]'', ''[[Babesia]]'', and ''[[Giardia]]''.<ref name="m202" /> Wolves may carry ''[[Neospora caninum]]'', which is of particular concern to farmers, as the disease can be spread to livestock, with infected animals being 3–13 times more likely to [[miscarriage|miscarry]] than those not infected.<ref name="wisconsin">{{cite web | url=http://dnr.wi.gov/org/land/er/publications/pdfs/wolf_impact.pdf | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090319050632/http://dnr.wi.gov/org/land/er/publications/pdfs/wolf_impact.pdf | archivedate=2009-03-19 |format=PDF| title=Effects of Wolves and Other Predators on Farms in Wisconsin: Beyond Verified Losses | publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources| accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref><ref name="Dubey 2011">{{cite doi|10.1016/j.vetpar.2011.05.018}}</ref> Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is ''[[Alaria (trematode)|Alaria]]'', which infects small rodents and amphibians, which are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, ''Alaria'' migrates to the wolf's intestine, but harms it little. ''Metorchis conjunctus'', which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing [[liver disease]], inflammation of the pancreas, and [[emaciation]]. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though ''[[Paragonimus westermani]]'' lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include [[constipation]], toxic and [[allergic reaction]]s, irritation of the [[intestinal mucosa]], and [[malnutrition]]. Infections by the tapeworm ''[[Echinococcus granulosus]]'' in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed ''Echinoccocus'' eggs in their feces onto grazing areas. Wolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. ''[[Ancylostoma caninum]]'' attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause [[hyperchromic anemia]], emaciation, [[diarrhea]], and possibly death. ''[[Toxocara canis]]'', a [[hookworm]] known to infect wolf pups in utero, can cause intestinal irritation, [[bloat]]ing, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch ''[[Dioctophyma renale]]'' from [[American mink|mink]]s, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of 100&nbsp;cm. ''D. renale'' causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue, and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of ''[[Dirofilaria immitis]]'' for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and [[congestive hepatopathy]]. Wolves probably become infected with ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'' by eating infected ungulates. Although ''T. spiralis'' isn't known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs.<ref name="m202" /> [[Thorny-headed worm]]s rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: ''Onicola skrjabini'', ''Macrocantorhynchus catulinus'', and ''[[Moniliformis moniliformis]]''.<ref name="m202" />

====In fable and literature====
[[File:Dore ridinghood.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' (1883), [[Gustave Doré]]]]
In the [[Babylon]]ian epic ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh|Gilgamesh]]'', one of the oldest texts in the world, the titular character rejects the sexual advances of the goddess [[Ishtar]], reminding her that she had transformed a previous lover, a shepherd, into a wolf, thus turning him into the very animal that his flocks must be protected against.<ref name="marvin46">{{Harvnb|Marvin|2012|pp=46–47}}</ref> According to the [[Avesta]], the [[sacred text]] of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]]s, wolves are a creation of the evil spirit [[Ahriman]], and are ranked among the most cruel of animals.<ref>''[[Yasna]]'', ix. 18–21</ref> [[Aesop]] featured wolves in several of his [[Aesop's Fables|fable]]s, playing on the concerns of [[Ancient Greece]]'s settled, sheep-herding world. His most famous is the fable of [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf]], which is directed at those who knowingly raise false alarms, and from which the idiomatic phrase "[[Wiktionary:cry wolf|to cry wolf]]" is derived. Some of his other fables concentrate on maintaining the trust between shepherds and guard dogs in their vigilance against wolves, as well as anxieties over the close relationship between wolves and dogs. Although Aesop used wolves to warn, criticize and moralize about human behaviour, his portrayals added to the wolf's image as a deceitful and dangerous animal.<ref name="marvin38">{{Harvnb|Marvin|2012|pp=38–40}}</ref> This is mirrored in the [[Bible]], where wolves are referenced thirteen times as symbols of [[greed]] and destructiveness.<ref name="BOTF">{{Cite book|author=Bright, Michael|title=Beasts of the Field: The Revealing Natural History of Animals in the Bible|year=2006|pages= 115–20|isbn=1-86105-831-4|publisher=Robson Books|location= London}}</ref> Much of the symbolism [[Jesus]] used in the [[New Testament]] revolved around the pastoral culture of Israel, and explained his relationship with his followers as analogous to that of a [[good shepherd]] protecting his flock from wolves. An innovation in the popular image of wolves started by Jesus includes the concept of the [[The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing|wolf in sheep's clothing]], which warns people against [[false prophet]]s.<ref name="marvin43">{{Harvnb|Marvin|2012|pp=43–45}}</ref> Several authors have proposed that Jesus's portrayal of wolves, comparing them to dangerous and treacherous people, was an important development in perceptions on the species, which legitimized centuries of subsequent wolf persecution in the [[western world]].<ref name="marvin43" /><ref name="l208">{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|p=208}}</ref><ref name="m293">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=293}}</ref> Subsequent medieval [[Christian literature]] followed and expanded upon Biblical teachings on the wolf. It appeared in the seventh century edition of the ''[[Physiologus]]'', which infused pagan tales with the spirit of Christian moral and mystical teaching. The ''Physiologus'' portrays wolves as being able to strike men dumb on sight, and of having only one [[cervical vertebra]]. [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] included a she-wolf, representing greed and [[fraud]], in the first [[canto]] of the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''. The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', first published in 1487, states that wolves are either agents of [[God]] sent to punish the wicked, or agents of [[Satan]], sent with God's blessing to test the faith of believers.<ref name="l219">{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|pp=205, 219 & 240}}</ref> Isengrim the wolf, a character first appearing in the 12th-century Latin poem ''[[Ysengrimus]]'', is a major character in the [[Reynard|Reynard Cycle]], where he stands for the low nobility, whilst his adversary, Reynard the fox, represents the peasant hero. Although portrayed as loyal, honest and moral, Isengrim is forever the victim of Reynard's wit and cruelty, often dying at the end of each story.<ref name="l259">{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|p=259}}</ref> The tale of [[Little Red Riding Hood]], first written in 1697 by [[Charles Perrault]], is largely considered to have had more influence than any other source of literature in forging the wolf's negative reputation in the western world.

[[Farley Mowat]]'s largely fictional 1963 memoir ''[[Never Cry Wolf]]'' was the first positive portrayal of wolves in popular literature, and is largely considered to be the most popular book on wolves, having been adapted into a [[Never Cry Wolf (film)|Hollywood film]] and taught in several schools decades after its publication. Although credited with having changed popular perceptions on wolves by portraying them as loving, cooperative and noble, it has been criticized for its idealization of wolves and its factual inaccuracies.<ref name="m294">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=294}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Jones, Karen |title=Never Cry Wolf'': Science, Sentiment, and the Literary Rehabilitation of ''Canis Lupus''|journal=The Canadian Historical Review|volume=84 |year=2001|url=http://wolfology1.tripod.com/id155.htm}}</ref><ref name="nevercrywolf">{{cite journal | last1 = Grooms | first1 = Steve | year = 2008 | title = The Mixed Legacy of ''Never Cry Wolf'' | url = http://www.wolf.org/wolves/news/pdf/fall2008.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Wolf | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 11–13 }}</ref> The book was later used by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in its campaign to suppress information about wolf attacks on humans.<ref>Geist, Valerius.

The last entry of the series is written from the wolves' point of view and, although anthropomorphized, the animals are crafted from a close reading of wolf biology and ethology. Several writers of modern children's literature have refashioned the image of wolves in classical fairy tales in order to portray them in a more positive light. Examples of this include ''Eco-wolf and the Three Little Pigs'' and ''The Wolf who cried Boy''.<ref name="marvin148">{{Harvnb|Marvin|2012|pp=148–152}}</ref>

====In heraldry and symbolism====
{{Main|Wolves in heraldry}}
[[File:Beli vukovi - wiki.png|thumb|Emblem of the Serbian "White Wolves"]]
The wolf is a frequent [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] in English armory. It is illustrated as a [[supporter]] on the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]]s of [[Lord Welby]], [[Lord Rendel|Rendel]], and [[Viscount Wolseley]], and can be found on the [[coat of arms]] of Lovett and the vast majority of the [[Wilson (surname)|Wilson]]s and Lows. The demi-wolf is a common [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]], appearing in the arms and crests of members of many families, including that of the [[Wolfe (surname)|Wolfe]]s, whose crest depicts a demi-wolf holding a crown in its paws, in reference to the assistance the family gave to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] during the [[battle of Worcester]]. Wolf heads are common in [[Scottish heraldry]], particularly in the coats of [[Clan Donnachaidh|Clan Robertson]] and [[Clan Skene|Skene]]. The wolf is the most common animal in [[Spanish heraldry]], and is often depicted as carrying a lamb in its mouth, or across its back.<ref>Davies, Arthur Charles Fox & Johnston, Graham (2004). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=0EBiwcy4x5EC&pg=PA196 A Complete Guide to Heraldry]''. Kessinger Publishing. pp. 196–197.

(2003). ''Native American Flags''. University of Oklahoma Press. pp. 48, 153, 166. ISBN 0806135565.</ref> In modern times, the wolf is widely used as an emblem for military and paramilitary groups. It is the unofficial symbol of the [[spetsnaz]], and serves as the logo of the Turkish [[Grey Wolves]]. During the [[Yugoslav Wars]], several [[Serb paramilitary]] units adopted the wolf as their symbol, including the White Wolves and the [[Wolves of Vučjak]].<ref name="marvin78">{{Harvnb|Marvin|2012|pp=78–79}}</ref>{{clear}}

===Livestock and dog predation===
[[File:Chinook2.gif|thumb|left|''Waiting for a Chinook'' (ca. 1900), [[Charles Marion Russell]]]]
Livestock depredation has been one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves, and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation: as well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found.<ref name="m305">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}}</ref> Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programmes or [[State Insurance|state insurance]].<ref name="m309">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=309}}</ref><br/>Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have evolved under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well.<ref name="mech173">{{Harvnb|Mech|1981|p=173}}</ref> Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted: in Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidences are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored.<ref name="m305" /> The majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, with untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation.<ref name="m307">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=307}}</ref> The most frequently targeted livestock species are [[sheep]] (Europe), [[reindeer herding|domestic reindeer]] (northern Scandinavia), [[goat]]s (India), [[horse]]s (Mongolia), [[cattle]] and [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]s (North America).<ref name="m305" /> As wolves tend to attack large prey from behind, cattle may be more vulnerable to wolves than horses, as horses can better defend their hindquarters with powerful kicks.<ref name="hunt38">{{Harvnb|Harding|1909|pp=38–39}}</ref> Different subspecies of wolf may preferentially target different animals: small bodied wolves rarely molest adult cattle, while large northern wolves are able to kill fully grown steers and sometimes horses unaided.<ref name="grisly186">{{Harvnb|Roosevelt|1909|pp=185–86}}</ref><br/>The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus.<ref name="m306">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=306}}</ref> Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures.<ref name="g45" /> Injuries caused by wolves on large-bodied livestock include [[Docking (animal)|docked]] ears and tails, and slash wounds to the lower legs.<ref name="g10" /> In some cases, wolves do not need to physically attack livestock to negatively affect it: the stress livestock experiences in being vigilant for wolves may result in [[miscarriage]]s, weight loss and a decrease in meat quality.<ref name="wisconsin" />

Wolves kill dogs on occasion, with some wolf populations relying on dogs as an important food source.<ref name="m305" /> Wolves generally outmatch dogs, even large ones, in physical confrontations, because of their larger heads and teeth and stronger bites.<ref name="grisly192">{{Harvnb|Roosevelt|1909|pp=192–3}}</ref><ref name="c134">{{Harvnb|Coppinger|Coppinger|2001|pp=134–5}}</ref> Also, the fighting styles of wolves and dogs differ significantly: while dogs typically limit themselves to attacking the head, neck and shoulder, wolves make greater use of body blocks, and attack the extremities of their opponents.<ref name="d18">{{Harvnb|Lindsay|2000|p=18}}</ref> In Croatia, wolves kill more dogs than sheep, and wolves in Russia appear to limit stray dog populations. Wolves may display unusually bold behaviour when attacking dogs accompanied by people, sometimes ignoring nearby humans.<ref name="m305" /> Wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests.<ref name="jess">Backeryd, J. (2007). "Wolf attacks on dogs in Scandinavia 1995 – 2005 – Will wolves in Scandinavia go extinct if dog owners are allowed to kill a wolf attacking a dog?", ''Examensarbete''.

Wolf-caused injuries on dogs are often located on the back, thighs and hind legs. The fatal wound is mostly a bite to the back of the neck. Large hunting dogs such as [[Jämthund|Swedish elkhound]]s are more likely to survive wolf attacks due to their better ability to defend themselves.<ref name="jess" />

===Attacks on humans===
{{Main|Wolf attacks on humans}}
[[File:Petit Journal Janvier 25 1914 Loup & Enfant.jpg|thumb|upright|''Child snatched by a wolf'' (1914), ''[[Le Petit Journal]]'']]
The fear of wolves has been pervasive in many societies, though humans are not part of the wolf's natural prey.<ref name="lin36" /> How wolves react to humans depends largely on their prior experience with people: wolves lacking any negative experience of humans, or are food conditioned, may show little fear of people.<ref name="m300">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=300, 302–304}}</ref> Overall, wolves are generally not dangerous to humans, as long as they are in low numbers, have sufficient food, have little contact with humans, and are occasionally hunted.<ref name="geist">Geist, Valerius (2006) [http://westinstenv.org/wp-content/Geist_when-do-wolves-become-dangerous-to-humans.pdf ''When do Wolves become Dangerous to Humans?''], The University of Calgary.</ref>

Although wolves may react aggressively under provocation, such attacks are mostly limited to quick bites on extremities, and the attacks are not pressed.<ref name="lin16">{{Harvnb|Linnell|2002|p=16}}</ref> Predatory attacks (attacks by wolves treating humans as food) may be preceded by a long period of [[habituation]], in which wolves gradually lose their fear of humans.<ref name="lin36" /> The victims are repeatedly bitten on the head and face, and are then dragged off and consumed, unless the wolves are driven off. Such attacks typically occur only locally, and do not stop until the wolves involved are eliminated.<ref name="lin15" /> Predatory attacks can occur at any time of the year, with a peak in the June–August period, when the chances of people entering forested areas (for livestock [[grazing]] or berry and mushroom picking) increase,<ref name="lin37" /> though cases of non-rabid wolf attacks in winter have been recorded in [[Belarus]], the [[Kirovsky District, Russia|Kirovsk]] and [[Irkutsk]] districts, [[Karelia]] and [[Ukraine]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=268}}</ref> Also, wolves with pups experience greater food stresses during this period. The majority of victims of predatory wolf attacks are children under the age of 18 and, in the rare cases where adults are killed, the victims are almost always women.<ref name="lin37" /> [[Wolf-dog hybrid]]s may be bolder than pure wolves, and live on the periphery of human settlements more readily, thus making them potentially more dangerous to livestock and human life.<ref name="g32">{{Harvnb|Graves|2007|pp=32 & 52–3}}</ref>

Cases of [[Rabies|rabid]] wolves are low when compared to other species, as wolves do not serve as primary reservoirs of the disease, but can be infected with rabies from other animals such as dogs, jackals and foxes. Cases of rabies in wolves are very rare in [[North America]], though numerous in the eastern [[Mediterranean]], [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]]. Wolves apparently develop the "furious" phase of rabies to a very high degree. This, coupled with their size and strength, makes rabid wolves perhaps the most dangerous of rabid animals,<ref name="lin14">{{Harvnb|Linnell|2002|p=14}}</ref> with bites from rabid wolves being 15 times more dangerous than those of rabid dogs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=267}}</ref> Rabid wolves usually act alone, travelling large distances and often biting large numbers of people and domestic animals. Most rabid wolf attacks occur in the spring and autumn periods. Unlike with predatory attacks, the victims of rabid wolves are not eaten, and the attacks generally only occur on a single day.<ref name="lin15">{{Harvnb|Linnell|2002|p=15}}</ref> Also, the victims are chosen at random, though the majority of cases involve adult men.<ref name="lin37">{{Harvnb|Linnell|2002|p=37}}</ref>

Wolf attacks on humans were a rare, but occasional feature of life in pre-20th-century Europe.

The North American continent has very few recorded incidences of such,<ref name="lin" /> though the [[oral history]] of some Native American tribes confirms that wolves occasionally did kill humans.

Wolf pelts are primarily used for [[scarf]]s and the [[Trim (sewing)|trimming]]s of women's garments, though they are occasionally used for [[jacket]]s, short [[cape]]s, [[coat (clothing)|coat]]s,<ref name="bach" /> [[mukluk]]s and [[Carpet|rugs]].<ref name="mech" /> Wolf pelts tend to be thinner than those of dogs, and are more prone to tearing when sewn.<ref name="c55">{{Harvnb|Coppinger|Coppinger|2001|p=55}}</ref> The quality of wolf peltries rests on the density and strength of the fur fibre, which keeps the fur upright and gives the pelt an appealing bushy aspect. These characteristics are mostly found in northern wolf populations, but gradually lessen further south in warmer climates. North American wolf pelts are among the most valuable, as they are silkier and fluffier than Eurasian peltries.<ref name="bach">{{cite book | author=Bachrach, M.| title=Fur: a practical treatise | year=1953 | pages=206–13 |  publisher=Prentice-Hall | location=New York}}</ref> The pelts of wolves killed by poison are mostly worthless.<ref name="hunt108">{{Harvnb|Harding|1909|p=108}}</ref> In [[Medieval Europe]], pelts were considered the only practical aspect of wolves, though they were seldom used, due to the skin's foul odour.<ref name="griff">{{cite book | author=Griffin, Emma| title=Blood sport: hunting in Britain since 1066 | year=2007 | page=65 | isbn=0-300-11628-4 | publisher=Yale University Press | location=}}</ref> In [[Scandinavian folklore]], wolf-skin [[girdle]]s assisted in transforming the wearers into werewolves,<ref>Woodward, Ian ''The Werewolf Delusion'' (1979) p. 121, Paddington Press Ltd.

The [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] wore wolf skins as capes when exploring enemy territories.<ref name="l111">{{Harvnb|Lopez|1978|pp=111–2}}</ref> The [[United States Army]] used wolf skin for [[parka]]s during the later stages of [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]] to protect the faces of soldiers from [[frostbite]].<ref name="bach" /> In the [[Soviet Union]], 30,000 wolf pelts were produced annually between 1976 and 1988. Recent statistics from [[CITES]] indicate that 6,000–7,000 wolf skins are internationally traded each year, with [[Canada]], the former Soviet Union, Mongolia and [[China]] being the largest exporters, and the [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]] being the largest importers. Overall, the harvesting of wolves for their fur has little impact on their population, as only the northern varieties (whose numbers are stable) are of commercial value.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=329}}</ref> Wolf trapping for fur remains a lucrative source of income for many Native Americans.<ref name="mech" />{{clear}}

It is rare for wolves to be hunted for food, though historically, people have resorted to consuming wolf flesh in times of scarcity, or for medicinal reasons. Wolf meat was eaten several times during [[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]]'s 1913 Arctic expedition, particularly during the summer, when wolves were fat.<ref>Steffanson, Vilhjamur (2004) ''My Life With The Eskimo'', Kessinger Publishing, p. 151, ISBN 1417923954</ref> Natives in [[Transbaikalia]] reportedly ate wolf meat even when food was plentiful.<ref name="cherassov94">Cherkassov, Alexander Alexandrovich (2012) ''Notes of an East Siberian Hunter'', Authorhouse, p. 94, ISBN 1468528971</ref> Most Native American tribes, particularly the [[Naskapi]]s, viewed wolf flesh as edible but inadequate nutrition, as it was not a herbivore and thus did not possess the same healing qualities thought to be distinct in plant eaters.<ref name="l111" /> The consumption of wolf flesh and organs plays an important role in Asian [[folk medicine]]: in [[Mongolia]], eating the meat and [[lungs]] of a wolf is said to alleviate colds, and sprinkling food with powdered wolf [[rectum]] is said to cure [[haemorroids]].<ref name="kohn">Kohn, Michael (2008) ''Mongolia'', [[Lonely Planet]], p. 50, ISBN 1741045789</ref> Some Japanese mountain people ate wolf meat to give them courage.<ref name="w32">{{Harvnb|Walker|2005|p=32}}</ref> During the filming of ''[[The Grey (film)|The Grey]]'', the cast members famously ate wolf meat.<ref name="latimes">{{Cite news|last=Lynch|first=Rene|title='The Grey' slammed for 'bloodthirsty' portrayal of wolves|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2012/01/the-grey-slammed-for-bloodthirsty-portrayal-of-wolves.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=28 January 2012}}</ref> Accounts on how wolf meat tastes vary greatly, with descriptions ranging from "tough",<ref name="w32" /> "gristly",<ref name="grillo">{{Cite news|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/51901/exclusive-interview-actor-frank-grillo-discusses-grey-complicated-bad-guys-eating-wolf-an|date=January 24, 2012 | title=Exclusive Interview: Actor Frank Grillo Discusses The Grey, Complicated Bad Guys, Eating Wolf and More | first=Heather| last=Wixson | work=[[Dread Central]]|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}</ref> "distasteful" and "smelly",<ref name="cherassov94" /> to "somewhat [resembling] [[chicken (food)|chicken]]",<ref>Jenness, Stuart Edward (2004), ''The Making Of An Explorer: George Hubert Wilkins And The Canadian Arctic Expedition, 1913–1916'', McGill-Queens, p. 159, ISBN 0773527982</ref> and "very superior to lean [[venison]]".<ref>Palliser, John (1853), ''Solitary rambles and adventures of a hunter in the prairies'', J.

===Wolves as pets===
{{Main|Wolves as pets and working animals}}
Tame wolves tend to be less predictable and manageable than dogs,<ref name="m304">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=304}}</ref> as they lack any alteration of their predatory behaviour, and can thus not be fully trusted in situations where their [[prey drive]] can be given adequate stimulation.<ref name="d18" /> Wolves are generally easier to tame than other wild canids, as they maintain infant attachments to family members and owners much longer, and also form secondary attachments to strangers much more readily.<ref name="fox1978" /> However, in contrast to dogs, which are usually accepting of strangers throughout their lives, treating them almost as an extension of their pack, wolves become increasingly [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] and intolerant of strangers not part of their immediate pack as they age.<ref name="d18" /> Despite this, the keeping of wolves as pets has grown in popularity, with an estimated 80,000 to 2 million privately owned wolves being present in the USA alone.<ref name="m304" /> While dog pups still have the ability to be [[socialisation|socialised]] at up to ten weeks of age, nineteen days may be too long to wait to begin socializing a wolf pup.<ref name="c42">{{Harvnb|Coppinger|Coppinger|2001|p=42}}</ref> Because wolf milk contains more [[arginine]] than can be found in puppy [[milk substitute]]s, an arginine supplement is needed when feeding pups below the weaning age. Failure to do so can result in the pups developing [[cataract]]s.<ref name="m197">{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=197}}</ref> While dogs readily, and actively form social bonds with humans, wolves can only do so in the absence of adult [[conspecifics]].<ref name="d20">{{Harvnb|Lindsay|2000|p=20}}</ref> Pups under one year of age are generally not aggressive toward strangers, though their aggression increases with age, particularly during the mating season. Males may be more aggressive and difficult to handle than females.<ref name="pavlov" /> Wolves are difficult to contain in standard [[kennel]]s, as they exceed dogs in [[observational learning]] and are able to quickly learn how to undo [[latch (hardware)|latch]]es by simply watching their handlers do so.<ref name="c46">{{Harvnb|Coppinger|Coppinger|2001|pp=46–7}}</ref> Once wolves learn how to escape confinement, it becomes nearly impossible to contain them.<ref name="d19">{{Harvnb|Lindsay|2000|p=19}}</ref>
